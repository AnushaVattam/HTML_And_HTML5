             <p>One of the most rewarding aspects of being a graduate student in the Department of Computer Science at Texas state University is the ability to work as a Graduate Instructional Assistant. This assistant ship was my first opportunity to run a classroom of my own. During my undergraduate career I participated as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant and enjoyed the opportunity to help students in the classes I had taken in Electronics and Communications.</p>

             <p>Currently, I teach a variety of labs at different levels including C, C++,Digital Logic's depending on the semester.I find it rewarding to challenge myself to teaching something I do not have a  background in before. I not only get to learn new topics but impart this newly acquired knowledge to my students!</p>

             <p>My experience in programming at Texas State and during my previous experience as an “Process Analyst” at Deloitte has enabled me to develop technical, professional skills like C, C++, JAVA, Python, PHP, Perl Databases, CSS, JavaScript, HTML, ETL tools, Weka, Team work. Now as a Teaching Assistant, where I teach and assist student in skills C, C++. </p>
